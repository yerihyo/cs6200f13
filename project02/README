# How to run

The program should run smoothly by executing a bash file, "src/run.bash". Some installation of python library program might be necessary.

The output files will be generated under "out/pm/result/" folder. The qrel evaluation result will be written in a file named "out/pm/result/<method_name>.<qrel_filename>". Table 1 shows the name of the methods used in the current implementation.
